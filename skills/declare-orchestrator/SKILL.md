  Use when working in a `declare`-managed repository (any directory containing

  Routes the agent to the correct role-skill (archaeologist, architect,

  silent semantic drift between human intent and generated code. Read this

# declare Orchestrator

`declare` is a Heuristic Intermediate Representation (HIR) for the agentic AI
era. The `.dx` file is the **source of truth** for intent and constraints; the
imperative code is a derived artifact. Your first job in any `declare` repo is
to figure out which role you are playing and load the corresponding skill.

This skill does not do work itself. It routes.

## 1. The Prime Directive

> **The `.dx` file is the source of truth.** Never write imperative code that
> violates a defined invariant. If an invariant is technically impossible to
> satisfy, propose a mutation to the `.dx` file rather than "fixing it in code."

Violating this rule is the single failure mode `declare` exists to prevent. If
you find yourself about to special-case the code to make it work, stop and
re-read the `.dx` file.

## 2. Role Routing

Pick exactly one role per task. Load its skill and follow it strictly.

| Trigger phrase / situation                                               | Load this skill        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| "Reverse-engineer this codebase into a `.dx` file."                      | `archaeologist`        |
| "There's no `.dx` here yet — distill one from the existing source."      | `archaeologist`        |
| "Write/refine the `.dx` file." / "Add an invariant." / "Tighten intent." | `architect`            |
| "Promote this assumption." / "Move X from assumptions to invariants."    | `architect`            |
| "Generate the implementation from `system.dx`."                          | `implementer`          |
| "Make the code conform to the spec." / "Fix this code to satisfy X."     | `implementer`          |
| "Verify the implementation against the contracts."                       | `judge`                |
| "Run the contracts. Tell me which ones fail and why."                    | `judge`                |
| Pure CLI usage (`declare lint`, `fmt`, `diff`, `export`)                 | `declare-toolchain`    |
| Reconciling a `.dx` merge (lint then diff against merge base)            | `declare-toolchain` §6a + `architect` |
| Spec questions ("Is folded scalar allowed?", "What goes in `intent`?")   | `dx-authoring`         |

If the task spans multiple roles (common), execute them **sequentially**:
architect → implementer → judge. Never have one role silently doing another's
job — for example, the implementer must not add or remove invariants; that is
strictly the architect's job.

## 3. Universal Pre-Flight Checks

Before any role-specific work:

1. **Locate the `.dx` files.** Run `ls *.dx` at the repo root and any obvious
   subdirectories. If there are none and the user is asking you to write code,
   stop and ask whether to invoke the `archaeologist` first.
2. **Validate them.** Run `declare lint <file>.dx` on every `.dx` file you
   intend to read or modify. Lint errors mean the file is structurally
   untrustworthy; fix them (as architect) before doing anything else.
3. **Check for an `AGENTS.md`.** It encodes repo-specific conventions that
   override generic skill guidance.

## 4. The Universal Invariants (apply to every role)

These come from `AGENTS.md` and apply regardless of which role-skill you
load. Re-read them before each non-trivial action.

### 4a. Explicit Assumption Logging (AGENTS.md §2)

When implementation requires a choice not specified in `intent` or
`invariants`, you **must not** choose silently.

1. Add an entry to the `assumptions:` block in the `.dx` file.
2. Document the heuristic leap **and why it was made**.
3. Only then proceed.

This is the single mechanism by which `declare` converts silent LLM
hallucinations into auditable, promotable workflow state. Skipping it
defeats the entire system.

### 4b. The Verification Loop (AGENTS.md §3)

Before declaring any task complete:

1. `declare lint` every modified `.dx` file. Must exit 0.
2. Generate or run the implementation.
3. Compare implementation behavior against the `contracts:` block.
4. Treat any contract failure as a **semantic bug**, not a flaky test.

### 4c. Pruning and Parsimony (AGENTS.md §4)

The architect's goal is the **minimum viable constraint set**. If a
requirement can be met without an explicit invariant, that requirement
belongs in `unconstrained:`, not `invariants:`. Over-specification is a
defect.

### 4d. Semantic Communication (AGENTS.md §5)

When summarizing changes for a human, summarize changes to **intent and
invariants**, not to lines of code. Use `declare diff <before>.dx
<after>.dx` rather than text diffs.

## 5. Handoff Protocol

When transitioning from one role to another within the same task, write a
single-line handoff in the conversation:

```
HANDOFF: <from-role> → <to-role>: <one-sentence reason>
```

Examples:

```
HANDOFF: architect → implementer: invariants are stable; generate Go code under cmd/.
HANDOFF: implementer → judge: implementation compiles and lints; run contracts.
HANDOFF: judge → architect: contract `greets_named_user` failed because the spec is
ambiguous about trailing whitespace — needs a new invariant or unconstrained entry.
```

This makes the loop legible to humans reviewing the transcript.

## 6. When to Stop and Ask

Escalate to the human (do not proceed silently) when:

- Two invariants directly contradict each other.
- A contract failure cannot be cleanly classified as either an implementation
  bug or a spec gap.
- You would need to add **more than three** new assumptions to make progress;
  that signals the spec is too sparse and the architect should be invoked
  explicitly by the human.
- The user requests imperative behavior that would violate an existing
  invariant. Cite the invariant by ID and ask whether to mutate the spec.

## 7. Anti-Patterns (Do Not Do)

- **"Fix it in code."** Never. Mutate the `.dx` file or escalate.
- **Silent assumption.** Never ship code that embeds a heuristic choice not
  recorded in `assumptions:`.
- **Role bleed.** The implementer never edits `invariants:`. The architect
  never writes the implementation. The judge never modifies either.
- **Skipping `declare lint`.** Always run it on every `.dx` file you touch.
- **Over-specifying.** If the human didn't constrain it, it belongs in
  `unconstrained:`, not in a fabricated invariant.
