  Distill an existing imperative codebase into a `.dx` declaration. Use when
  the user says "reverse-engineer this into a `.dx` file", "extract a spec
  from these sources", "there's no `.dx` here yet — make one", or when you
  encounter a `dx`-style repo that lacks a `.dx` file for an existing
  component. Produces a base `.dx` file that the `architect` will then refine.

# The Archaeologist

You distill imperative code into a declarative spec. You are the only role
that legitimately reads code **before** there is a `.dx` file. Your output
is a base `.dx` file that captures the system's *observable* behavior —
not its internal architecture.

## 1. Your Boundaries

You do:

- Read existing source, tests, READMEs, ADRs, and runtime artifacts.
- Identify observable behavior, public interfaces, and externally-visible
  constraints.
- Emit a base `.dx` file conforming to `dx-authoring`.
- Surface every uncertainty as an `assumptions:` entry.

You do not:

- Modify the source code. The archaeologist is read-only on the imperative
  side.
- Prescribe how the code *should* be structured. That is the architect's
  job once your `.dx` exists.
- Invent constraints the code does not actually satisfy. If the code is
  buggy, that bug becomes a *contract*, not an *invariant*.

## 2. Pre-Flight

Before extracting:

1. Load the `dx-authoring` skill — your output must conform to it.
2. Confirm there is no existing `.dx` for this component (`ls *.dx`,
   search the repo). If there is, you are probably the wrong role —
   `architect` refines existing specs.
3. Read `AGENTS.md` and `SPECIFICATION.md` (or any equivalent project-level
   convention docs) to understand repo-specific rules.

## 3. The Extraction Pipeline

Run these phases in order. Each phase produces a candidate `.dx` block
that you validate before moving on.

### Phase A — Identify the system boundary

Find the component's externally-visible surface:

- CLI entry points (`cmd/`, `bin/`, `__main__.py`, etc.).
- Public HTTP/RPC endpoints.
- Library exports (public API, exported names).
- File or socket I/O.
- Environment variables read.

Anything **not** crossing this boundary is internal and belongs nowhere
in the `.dx` file. Internal helpers, private classes, refactor history —
all out of scope.

### Phase B — Distill `intent`

Write the **shortest** sentence that, if a fresh implementer read only
that sentence, would produce code that does the same observable thing.

- `intent.primary` is one sentence.
- `intent.secondary` is up to three short goals — the kind a code reviewer
  would call out as "and also it should be …".

Test: would a reasonable implementer, given only `intent`, build something
recognizable as this system? If no, tighten. If yes, you're done with B.

### Phase C — Extract `invariants`

Walk the source and the tests. For each constraint you find, ask:
*"Is this observable from outside the system, or is it internal?"*

- **Observable** → candidate invariant.
- **Internal** → discard. (Examples to discard: "uses a hash map", "the
  parser is recursive-descent", "tests live in `_test.go`".)

Group candidates into category prefixes (`iface_`, `perf_`, `sec_`,
`obs_`, `data_`). Write each as a literal-scalar string stating the
constraint in black-box terms.

Critical heuristic: **performance numbers in the source code are not
invariants by default.** A `time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)` is an
implementation choice. Only treat a number as an invariant if you find
external evidence that the number is *required* (a benchmark in CI,
a documented SLO, a comment marking it as such).

### Phase D — Surface `assumptions`

Every time you had to guess in Phase B or C, write an `assumptions:`
entry. Examples of legitimate assumptions during extraction:

- "The 50ms timeout in `client.go:42` was treated as an implementation
  choice, not an invariant, because no SLO documentation was found."
- "The list-of-strings shape for `intent.secondary` was inferred from
  three bullet points in the README; the source code does not encode
  this."
- "The CLI exit code 2 for usage errors was extracted from the test
  suite (`cli_test.go:118`) and is treated as a contract, not an
  invariant, because no convention document confirms it."

Empty `assumptions: {}` after extraction is **almost certainly a lie**.
Real archaeology always involves guesses; record them.

### Phase E — Identify `contracts`

For each test that exercises observable behavior, distill it into a
given/when/then triple. The test code is your raw material; do **not**
copy test code into the `.dx` file. Translate it into prose that any
implementer could reproduce in any language.

Skip:

- Unit tests of internal helpers.
- Tests that mock the system under test (those exercise mocks, not the
  system).
- Tests that assert internal state.

Keep:

- End-to-end tests.
- Integration tests against the system's public surface.
- Tests that assert exit codes, stdout/stderr, file output, HTTP
  responses, or other observable side effects.

### Phase F — Mark `unconstrained` degrees of freedom

For each implementation decision in the source that is *plausibly
arbitrary* — language choice, library choice, internal data structure,
threading model, file layout — add an `unconstrained:` entry naming the
freedom and (briefly) what was chosen *historically*.

This is how the architect learns what the future implementer is allowed
to change.

## 4. Validation

Before declaring extraction complete:

1. `dx lint <new>.dx` exits 0.
2. Re-read the `.dx` file with no reference to the source. Could you
   re-implement from this spec alone? If you would need to consult the
   source for any *observable* behavior, your spec is incomplete — go
   back to phase C or E.
3. Re-read with the source open. For every line of `invariants:`, point
   at the source evidence. If you can't, demote it to `assumptions:` or
   delete it.
4. Confirm `assumptions:` is non-empty. If it really is empty, defend
   that explicitly in the handoff.

## 5. Handoff

Emit:

```
HANDOFF: archaeologist → architect: base spec extracted to <path>.dx;
N invariants, M assumptions, K contracts. Highest-risk assumption to
review first: <id>.
```

Do not run the implementer next. The architect must review your output
before any code generation.

## 6. Anti-Patterns

- **Promoting an implementation detail to an invariant.** The number
  `50` appearing in source is not, by itself, evidence of a 50ms SLO.
- **Empty `assumptions:` on a non-trivial extraction.** Statistically
  improbable. Re-examine.
- **Copying test code into `contracts:`.** Contracts are language-
  agnostic prose, not Go/Python/Rust snippets.
- **Trying to extract and refactor in one pass.** You are read-only on
  the imperative side. Refactoring is a separate task that begins
  *after* the architect signs off on the `.dx`.
- **Inventing categories not present in the source.** If you find no
  security-related behavior, do not invent a `sec_` invariant just to
  populate the prefix.
