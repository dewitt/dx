# `dx` Skills

This directory contains the agent skills that operationalize the `dx`
paradigm. Each subdirectory follows the Anthropic Agent Skills convention:
a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) followed by
prose instructions. The format is intentionally portable across coding
agents — Claude, Cursor, CloudCode, Gemini-based loops, etc. — so any agent
that consumes Markdown playbooks can use them directly.

## How to use

Point your agent at this directory (or copy the subdirectories into the
agent's skill search path). The orchestrator skill is the entry point and
explains how to route any incoming task to the correct role.

If your agent does not auto-load skills, instruct it to read
`skills/dx-orchestrator/SKILL.md` first.

## Skill Index

| Skill                  | Role                | When to load                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dx-orchestrator` | Meta / router       | Always, on entering any `dx`-managed repo. Routes to the role-skills below.          |
| `dx-authoring`         | Spec reference      | Whenever you are about to write or modify a `.dx` file.                                   |
| `dx-toolchain`    | CLI usage           | Whenever you are about to invoke `dx lint / fmt / diff / export`. Also covers the post-merge ritual (SPEC §3.9). |
| `archaeologist`        | Role: extraction    | "Reverse-engineer this codebase into a `.dx` file."                                       |
| `architect`            | Role: refinement    | "Write/refine the `.dx` file." Owns `intent`, `invariants`, `contracts`, `unconstrained`. |
| `implementer`          | Role: coding        | "Generate the implementation from `system.dx`." May only modify `assumptions:`.           |
| `judge`                | Role: verification  | "Verify the implementation against the contracts." (Until `dx verify` ships in v0.2, the judge skill *is* the contract executor.) |

## Design notes

- The skills assume the universal rules in the repo-root `AGENTS.md` are in
  effect. They cite specific sections of `AGENTS.md` and `SPECIFICATION.md` rather
  than restating those documents.
- The four role-skills (`archaeologist`, `architect`, `implementer`,
  `judge`) deliberately have **non-overlapping write privileges** on the
  `.dx` file:

  | Block            | Archaeologist | Architect | Implementer | Judge |
  | ---------------- | :-----------: | :-------: | :---------: | :---: |
  | `system`         |       W       |     W     |      —      |   —   |
  | `intent`         |       W       |     W     |      —      |   —   |
  | `invariants`     |       W       |     W     |      —      |   —   |
  | `assumptions`    |       W       |     W     |      W      |   —   |
  | `contracts`      |       W       |     W     |      —      |   —   |
  | `unconstrained`  |       W       |     W     |      —      |   —   |

  (The archaeologist writes the file from scratch, so it can populate
  every block; once it exists, only the architect may modify the
  spec-defining blocks. The implementer's write privilege is limited to
  appending `assumptions:`.)

- The handoff format `HANDOFF: <from> → <to>: <reason>` is shared across
  all skills. It is the audit trail.

## Contributing

When updating these skills, remember:

- The skills must remain portable. Avoid commands or features specific to
  one agent runtime.
- Keep frontmatter minimal: `name` and `description` only.
- The `description` field is what an auto-discovery system uses to decide
  whether to load the skill. Lead with concrete trigger phrases ("Use
  when the user asks to …").
- If you change a role's write privileges, update the table above and the
  matching language in the affected role's SKILL.md.
