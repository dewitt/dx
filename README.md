# declare

A declarative language and toolchain for the agentic AI era.

`declare` provides a formal boundary between high-level design and
imperative implementation. In a world where AI writes the code,
`declare` ensures that humans (and the agents that work with them)
maintain control over the **intent** and **constraints** of a system
without being mired in the syntax of any particular implementation.

> **Status:** v0.1.0 development. The CLI lints and diffs `.dx` files
> today; `fmt` and `export` are deliberate stubs and `verify` is
> deferred to v0.2 (see [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) §4 for the rationale).

## Why declare exists

Modern coding agents excel at writing imperative code from prompts but
fail in two predictable ways: they silently invent missing details, and
they drift across iterations. `declare` addresses both:

- **`.dx` files** — a strict YAML subset — capture *intent*,
  *invariants*, *contracts*, and *unconstrained degrees of freedom* in
  a form humans can read and machines can validate.
- **An `assumptions:` block** turns silent hallucinations into
  auditable, promotable workflow state. Every heuristic an agent makes
  is recorded *before* it touches the code.
- **A deterministic CLI** (`declare lint`, `declare diff`) enforces
  the spec and reports semantic changes — not text changes — when the
  spec evolves.

There is no LLM inside the `declare` binary. The intelligence lives in
the agents that consume it; the binary is the referee.

## Quick start

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dewitt/declare && cd declare
go build -o ./bin/declare ./cmd/declare
```

The binary is statically linked Go; drop it on `$PATH` to use it
anywhere.

### Lint a `.dx` file

```bash
./bin/declare lint examples/hello.dx
# examples/hello.dx: ok
```

### Diff two specs semantically

```bash
./bin/declare diff old.dx new.dx
# [MUTATED] intent.primary
# [PROMOTED] assumptions.cache.location -> invariants.iface_cache_path
# [ADDED] unconstrained.language
```

`declare diff` reports operations against the schema, not lines of
YAML — so reordering keys or reflowing a literal scalar produces zero
noise, and the canonical assumption-promotion workflow shows up in one
line.

### Bootstrap an agent

Any coding agent that consumes Markdown skills can adopt the
`declare` workflow today. Point it at the [`skills/`](skills/)
directory; the [`declare-orchestrator`](skills/declare-orchestrator/SKILL.md)
skill is the entry point and routes to the four role-skills
(archaeologist, architect, implementer, judge).

## What's in `.dx`

A `.dx` file is YAML 1.2 with a strict subset enforced by `declare
lint`. The required blocks are `system`, `intent`, `invariants`, and
`assumptions`; `contracts` and `unconstrained` are optional but
strongly encouraged.

A minimal example:

```yaml
system: hello-world

intent:
  primary: |
    Greet a user by name on standard output.

invariants:
  iface_stdout: |
    Writes a single UTF-8 line to stdout terminated by `\n`.

assumptions:
  greeting.format: |
    The greeting is "Hello, <name>!". The spec does not pin the
    punctuation; this matches the canonical POSIX-tutorial form.

contracts:
  greets_named_user:
    given: |
      The argument vector contains exactly one non-empty name.
    when: |
      The binary is invoked.
    then: |
      stdout contains "Hello, <name>!\n" and the exit code is 0.

unconstrained:
  language: |
    Any language with a stable POSIX runtime is acceptable.
```

A larger worked example with a real C++ legacy implementation and a
Python re-synthesis lives at
[`examples/weather_cli/`](examples/weather_cli/).
